# Genre/Story/Mechanics Summary
- Cyber/Space pirate, traveling from planet to planet collecting treasure and fighting off rival ships in space. Treasure hunt style–each treasure you collect guides you to the next one, with the final treasure being at the end of the hunt. (Adventure Pillar)
- Each planet is unique and unknown, no information to guide you aside from the knowledge that a treasure is there (Mysterious Pillar)
- Collectathon–find the treasure on each planet, and gather resources to upgrade your ship with whatever bag space you have left (Adventure Pillar)
- Planetside–side scrolling movement with a focus on collecting items with limited space, strategize what materials you want for upgrading the ship (Adventure Pillar)
- In space–this is where combat occurs. Bullet hell style combat fighting off rival ships on your way to the next destination. Top down, think like space invaders/touhou. (Chaos pillar)
- General gameplay loop: land planetside → collect target item and upgrade materials until you can’t carry any more → return to ship, spend materials for upgrades → in space, fight off enemies for a given amount of time until you reach the next planet. (Mysterious/Adventure Pillar)
